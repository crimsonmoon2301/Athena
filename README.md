# What is Athena?

Athena is a C# app built in WPF that allows you to do basically anything you want in Windows. 

## What functions are added in so far?
  * Registry editor. So far it's rather basic. Will likely be overhauled soon. Might merge with debloater together to avoid fragmentation.
  * System information
  * Background switch with a fade animation
  * MVVM principle is followed to make it user friendly.

## Possible checklist?
  * Add an ISO builder function in with the help of UUP Dumps.
  * Windows/Office downloader through a mirror.
  * System monitor, more sane commands for script generation.

### Possible dependencies.
  * The app is based around .NET 8.0 which is the LTS version in Windows.
  * Windows 10 and 11 is supported. Older versions are untested.
  * No standalone program available yet as this is highly WIP.
